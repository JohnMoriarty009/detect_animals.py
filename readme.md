# Simple Python Sales Tracking System üìà

Welcome to the Simple Python Sales Tracking System repository! This project is a basic command-line application built in Python to help track sales records, calculate total revenue, and export data.

## ‚ú® Project Description

This application provides a straightforward way to manage sales data for small-scale tracking. It uses a lightweight SQLite database to store information persistently and offers a simple command-line interface for interaction. The project demonstrates fundamental database operations (Create, Read, Calculate) and integrates with the `pandas` library for convenient data export to Excel.

## üöÄ Features

* **Add New Sales:** Record details for each sale, including customer information, product details, price, and quantity.
* **View All Sales:** Display a list of all recorded sales with all relevant details.
* **Calculate Total Revenue:** Compute and show the sum of `total_revenue` for all sales.
* **Export to Excel:** Export all sales data from the database into a neatly formatted Excel file (`.xlsx`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **SQLite:** A serverless, file-based database used for storing sales records.
* **pandas:** A powerful data manipulation library used here specifically for exporting data to Excel.
* **openpyxl:** A library that `pandas` uses under the hood to write `.xlsx` files.

## prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need the `pandas` and `openpyxl` libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

## How to Use üñ±Ô∏è

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/JohnMoriarty009>
    cd <https://github.com/JohnMoriarty009/sales_tracking.py>
    ```
2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python sales_tracking.py # Assuming you named your script sales_tracking.py
    ```
3.  Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the application:
    * Enter `1` to add a new sale.
    * Enter `2` to view all sales.
    * Enter `3` to calculate the total revenue.
    * Enter `4` to export data to an Excel file (`sales_export.xlsx`).
    * Enter `5` to exit the application.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Journey: How We Built It

This project was built step-by-step:

1.  **Database Initialization:** We started by setting up the SQLite database connection and creating the `sales` table to define the structure for storing our sales records (`id`, `customer_name`, `customer_contact`, `sale_date`, `product_name`, `price`, `quantity`, `total_revenue`).
2.  **Adding Sales:** We implemented a function to insert new sales records into the database. This included calculating the `total_revenue` (`price * quantity`) automatically before saving.
3.  **Viewing Sales:** A function was created to retrieve all sales records from the database and display them in a readable, tabular format in the console.
4.  **Calculating Total Revenue:** We added functionality to query the database and calculate the sum of the `total_revenue` for all sales, providing the total income generated.
5.  **Creating the User Interface:** A simple command-line menu loop was developed to allow users to easily select and perform actions (add, view, total, export, exit) without needing to modify the code.
6.  **Exporting to Excel:** We integrated the `pandas` library to add an export feature, allowing all stored sales data to be easily saved as an `.xlsx` file.

## üêõ Correction Made

During the development of the `view_sales` function, we specifically addressed how to handle cases where the `customer_contact` might be `None` (if the user didn't provide contact information when adding a sale). The correction ensures that instead of printing `None`, the output shows "N/A" for better readability in the sales list display.

## üåü Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future improvements:

* Add functionality to edit or delete sales records.
* Implement filtering options (e.g., view sales by date range, by customer, by product).
* Add more robust input validation.
* Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of a command-line interface.
* Include reporting features (e.g., sales summaries by product or month).
